# Vehicle Fuel Efficiency Prediction

The aim of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the fuel efficiency of vehicles based on their characteristics, using linear regression.

## Dataset

Dataset source: <https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/auto+mpg>

## Results

The model achieved an R-squared value of 0.819 for the training set and 0.845 for the testing set, indicating that it was able to explain a large amount of the variability in the data. Additionally, the root mean squared error (RMSE) for the training set was 3.370 and for the testing set was 2.888.

## Requirements

In order to run the python script and notebook, you will need to have the following packages installed:

* matplotlib
* numpy
* pandas
* scikit-learn
